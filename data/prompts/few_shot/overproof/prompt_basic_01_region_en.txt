Travelling with a motor caravan and armed motorcycle scouts, twenty armed bandits early today swooped down on the Old Horpey Distillery, near Frederick, Md., and made off with $84,000 worth of choice old whiskey, leaving three Government watchmen bound and gagged, under threat of instant death if they attempted to raise an alarm. % Beyond the fact that an abandoned truck, laden with seventeen barrels of the stolen whiskey, was found eight miles from Frederick on the Baltimore pike, there is no clue to the direction taken by the caravan.

The raid was evidently carried out after days of thorough preparation. The distillery is thought to have been under close surveillance, day and night, by bandit spies, who learned every movement of the watchmen. Seven Autos In Raid. With motorcycles far to the front and following as a rear guard, the twenty bandits, with three big automobile trucks and four touring cars, drove up to the distillery at 2 o'clock this morning. While the motorcycle men scattered to guard every approach to the building, fifteen of the bandits broke into the office and overpowered the three watchmen-John R. Hemp, of Burkettaville, Md.: William Hart, of Baltimore, and John Moredock. of Baltimore. The three watchmen were tightly bound and gagged and an armed man stood over them until the ranges left more than two hours later. From fifty to sixty barrels of the aged whiskey, approximately 2,106 gallons In all, was rolled from the building and leaded on the trucks and touring cars. It took the bandits until nearly 4: o'clock to complete the loading of the caravan Then the motorcycle outposts reported the roads clear. The watch men were admonished against any attempt to escape and the caravan made off. Telephone Lines Cut. Hemp finally broke loose. He found the telephone lines had been cut and was forced to walk, a long distance before he could spread the alarm. Sheriff James C. Jones was notified and telephoned the police at all nearby points to watch dvery road away from Frederick In spite of the network, the bandits managed to slip through, and no clue no to the direction they took has been discovered, except for the abandoned truck at Jefferson. it is the belief of Sheriff Jones that the bandits were the same men who robbed the distillery of 200 cases of whiskey December 9 la*. Much of the deer liquor was brought to Washington on that occasion and was sold by bootleggers at a high price Posed as Dry Agent. The watchmen told Sheriff Jones that at 2 o'clock a man who represented himself as an internal revenue agent from Washington appeared at the door of the office and demanded admittance. As the door was opened, his confederates pushed their way- in with drawn revolvers. The watchmen were threatened with death If they made any outcry or attempt to escape and one shot was fired by way of warning. Then the watchmen were backed against the wall, disarmed, and tied hand and foot with heavy cords. Handkerchief were stuffed into their mouths and they were bound With the guards tied and aged, the bandits worked quickly.

The Pageant of Nations," which was presented in the Sydney Town Hall last night, and will be staged every night this week as part of the Anniversary celebrations, is one of the most spectacular and. elaborately - produced en- tertainments ever seen in Australia. Full of glittering colour, the pageant is something of a feast both for the eye and the car, in its brilliant national settings, ensembles, and dances, and in its sparkling music. Tile crowded hall was almost transformed, with the organ blotted out, a vast gold pillared stage and centre platform built specially for the occasion, and more than 2000 men, women and children in a blaze of spotlights for a score or more of lavish scenes. The pageant was written and produced by Mr. J. J. Collins for the Celebrations Council, in collaboration with the Consular Corps. It was attended by the Governor and Lady Wakehurst, the Chief Justice, Sir Frederick Jordan, and Lady Jordan, the Premier and Mrs. Stevens, the Minister in Charge of the Celebrations, Mr. Dlinnlnghnm, and Mrs. Dunningham, and other representative citizens. JOHN BULL'S CONGRATULATIONS. The brilliant scene opened with a prelude in which partly John Bull (Mr. Claude Flem- ing), grasping the hand of young Australia (Master Ronald Rouscl), briefly addressed the audience and expressed the pride with which they were celebrating the 150th birthday of one of their sturdiest sons." The strikingly impressive Empire pageant, constituting the first part of the programme and followed by the pageant and parade of the nations, Is headed by England, symbolised by an old English inn in the background; the Sydney Folk Song Choir, as huntsmen in rollicking hunting songs, and by a ballet of young women, also In hunting costume. The scene shifts to India, with lavishly-costumpd girls, traders, beggars, and tourists In a bazaar. With his entourage in glittering robes and turbans, an Indian prince makes a majestic entry. Canada next comes into the sparkling picture. Members of the Langlea Operatic Society, in the uniforms of the Canadian Royal North-west Mounted Police, sing a spirited chorus as they march down the centre platform and join Totem Pole girls and Red Indians, and Rose Marie (Miss Gwladys Evans). IRELAND AND WALES. Ireland is next brilliantly portrayed, in an enchanting assemblage of colleen and harpists, the scene closing with a joyous Irish jig. Then comes Wales, with men and women in picturesque national costumes, and folk songs by the Sydney Folk Song Choir. There is another storm of applause as a sturdy Maori chieftain conveys the greetings of New Zealand and Samoa, and is followed by Maori men and girls, in posture dances and other movements. Following New Zealand comes South Africa. Through a huge portrait of Cecil Rhodes is seen family, first, a university quadrangle, symbolising Rhodes's great work in the cause of education, and then a diamond mine. Miss South Africa closes a brilliant scene as she moves up the steps and unfolds a vast black train, shimmering with diamonds. Scotland next comes into the scene with the merry skirt of pipes, the joyous swing of kilts and spirited Scottish dancing and marching. EMPIRE PARADE. Even more spectacular and impressive is the closing Empire parade, in which 25 or more countries are represented, in period settings and traditional costumes, and headed by standard-bearers. The last to make it entry is Australia, symbolised strikingly by picturesquely-costumed characters, represent- ing gum nuts, koalas, waratah, wattles, and flannel flowers. Following Australia, and closing the stately procession, is Britannia. The vast stage is a blaze of colour as Britannia takes the centre of it, and is joined by Young Australia on her right and John Bull on her left to the inspiring and stirring notes of "Land of Hope r^d Glory." PARADE OF NATIONS. The nations of the world are represented in magnificent scenes featuring their national music and dances. With the whole of them finally grouped, the curtains rise to reveal also the British Empire. On the entry of Young Australia, there is a burst of joyous music and white doves soaring above as the figure of Peace appears. The choir, conducted by Mr. Horace Keats, also plays a distinctive part in the pageant.
