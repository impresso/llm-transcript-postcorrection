Correct the spelling and grammar of the following text: I ENGLAND DEFERS ' CHOICE OF TEAM FOR TEST ; By TOM GOODMAN Final selection of England's team for the first Rugby League Test on Monday will not be considered before Sunday, the team manager, Mr. Walter Popplewell, said last night. It is doubtful if Harry Murphy and Bob Nichol- 1 son, two of England's youngest forwards, will be able J to play again on the tour. At least four of England's Test forwards will have to play against Newcastle at Newcastle to-morrow. Ted Ward, a centre, will play in the pack to allow star Jack - forward, Ike Owens, to have a well-earned rest. Fit players who will not appear at Newcastle are Gus Risman Albert Johnson, Eric Batten, Ernest Ward, Willie Horne, and Tom McCue (backs), Ike Owens, and probably Les White (forwards). It is a pity that Joe Jones's knee trouble will prevent him from playing at full-back. ' Otherwise, either Martin Ryan of lack Kitching would have been rested A more thorough deduction as to , Test team possibilities could then have been made. Jones is the only back on the in- jured list. Jenkins Back I Dai Jenkins, Leeds half-back, will have his first game since he injured a knee at Canberra. He has been training during the past few days. Jenkins, however, is below best condition. It does not seem likely that he can force his way into the Test Team. It would not be a great surprise if Marun Ryan were to be played in the Test at half-back, as in the match against New South Wales last Saturday, with Gus Risman full-back and Jack Kitching partnering Ernest Ward in the centre. But the chances are that experienced rugged, Tom McCue, despite that he was below his best at Wollongong and Orange, will retain his place as Eng- land's first half-back. Barring accidents, the teams in the Test on Monday may line up as follows: ENGLAND. AUSTRALIA. Full-back. M Ryan. O. Parkinson. Three quarters. E. Batten. L. Cooper. E. Ward, ft- Barter. A. J. Risman c. I. Jorsenson J. A Johnson E. Newham. five-eighth. W. Horne. P. Devery half-back. T. McCue i Grice. Forwards. L Owens. N. Mulligan. L. White. A. Clues D. Phillips. R. Ksj. K. Gee F. Farrell. J. Esan. G. Watt. F. Whitcombe. H- Westaway. Only Seven Fit Of England's 11 forwards, only ; seven were fit to be considered for the Newcastle match. I The Englishmen hoped- that Fred Hughes would be available to take a place in the front row. Hughes found at training yesterday that his ankle was still troublesome. Trevor Foster's knee injury robs a him of any chance of qualifying for a place in the Test pack. ' Harry Murphy, with a displaced collarbone, still has his left arm at the horizontal, supported by a splint. Bob Nicholson, with a recurrence of pleurisy, is in bed again, and it is unlikely that he, will play again in Australia. Mr. Popplewell announced the following team to play against Near castle: Full-back: M. Ryan. Three-quarters: J. Lewthwaite. J, Kitching, B. Knowelden, A. Bassett Five-eighths: W. Davies. Half-back: D. Jenkins Forwards K. Gee, J. Egan. P, Whitcombe, G. Curran, D. Phillips, Ted Ward, L. White (one to be omitted). It is a pity the New South Wales selection committee was not represented at the Orange match. This will probably rob Bathurst full-back. O. Kennerson, of any chance of being chosen in the New South Wales team to play Queensland in Brisbane. His tackling and long kicking were outstanding at Orange. BATHURST, Thursday. - Oriel Kennerson, Bathurst full-back, has had two offers to transfer to Sydney clubs, but has not made any decision. One offer was from Eastern Suburbs.

Correct the spelling and grammar of the following text: PAGEANT OF NATIONS." GREAT SPECTACLE. Magnificent Scenes. The Pageant of Nations," which was presented in the Sydney Town Hall last night, and will be staged every night this week as part of the Anniversary celebrations, is one of the most spectacular and. elaborately - produced en- tertainments ever seen in Australia. Full of glittering colour, the pageant is something of a feast both for the eye and the car, in its brilliant national settings, ensembles, and dances, and in its sparkling music. Tile crowded hall was almost transformed, with the organ blotted out, a vast gold pillared stage and centre platform built specially for the occasion, and more than 2000 men, women and children in a blaze of spotlights for a score or more of lavish scenes. The pageant was written and produced by Mr. J. J. Collins for the Celebrations Council, in collaboration with the Consular Corps. It was attended by the Governor and Lady Wakehurst, the Chief Justice, Sir Frederick Jordan, and Lady Jordan, the Premier and Mrs. Stevens, the Minister in Charge of the Celebrations, Mr. Dlinnlnghnm, and Mrs. Dunningham, and other representative citizens. JOHN BULL'S CONGRATULATIONS. The brilliant scene opened with a prelude in which partly John Bull (Mr. Claude Flem- ing), grasping the hand of young Australia (Master Ronald Rouscl), briefly addressed the audience and expressed the pride with which they were celebrating the 150th birthday of one of their sturdiest sons." The strikingly impressive Empire pageant, constituting the first part of the programme and followed by the pageant and parade of the nations, Is headed by England, symbolised by an old English inn in the background; the Sydney Folk Song Choir, as huntsmen in rollicking hunting songs, and by a ballet of young women, also In hunting costume. The scene shifts to India, with lavishly-costumpd girls, traders, beggars, and tourists In a bazaar. With his entourage in glittering robes and turbans, an Indian prince makes a majestic entry. Canada next comes into the sparkling picture. Members of the Langlea Operatic Society, in the uniforms of the Canadian Royal North-west Mounted Police, sing a spirited chorus as they march down the centre platform and join Totem Pole girls and Red Indians, and Rose Marie (Miss Gwladys Evans). IRELAND AND WALES. Ireland is next brilliantly portrayed, in an enchanting assemblage of colleen and harpists, the scene closing with a joyous Irish jig. Then comes Wales, with men and women in picturesque national costumes, and folk songs by the Sydney Folk Song Choir. There is another storm of applause as a sturdy Maori chieftain conveys the greetings of New Zealand and Samoa, and is followed by Maori men and girls, in posture dances and other movements. Following New Zealand comes South Africa. Through a huge portrait of Cecil Rhodes is seen family, first, a university quadrangle, symbolising Rhodes's great work in the cause of education, and then a diamond mine. Miss South Africa closes a brilliant scene as she moves up the steps and unfolds a vast black train, shimmering with diamonds. Scotland next comes into the scene with the merry skirt of pipes, the joyous swing of kilts and spirited Scottish dancing and marching. EMPIRE PARADE. Even more spectacular and impressive is the closing Empire parade, in which 25 or more countries are represented, in period settings and traditional costumes, and headed by standard-bearers. The last to make it entry is Australia, symbolised strikingly by picturesquely-costumed characters, represent- ing gum nuts, koalas, waratah, wattles, and flannel flowers. Following Australia, and closing the stately procession, is Britannia. The vast stage is a blaze of colour as Britannia takes the centre of it, and is joined by Young Australia on her right and John Bull on her left to the inspiring and stirring notes of "Land of Hope r^d Glory." PARADE OF NATIONS. The nations of the world are represented in magnificent scenes featuring their national music and dances. With the whole of them finally grouped, the curtains rise to reveal also the British Empire. On the entry of Young Australia, there is a burst of joyous music and white doves soaring above as the figure of Peace appears. The choir, conducted by Mr. Horace Keats, also plays a distinctive part in the pageant.
